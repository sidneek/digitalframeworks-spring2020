# Interviewing Data

### I took a look at two datasets that I found on github summarizing state restrictions due to COVID-19. The data sources for the project were state health deparment reports. [Here is a link to the project](https://github.com/govex/COVID-19/tree/master/data_tables).

## Questions:
1. How many states reported data broken down by race on who is getting tested for COVID-19?
2. Did the states with racial data on virus testing have any similarities in implemented restrictions?
3. Did states with more relaxed restrictions show trends in virus testing, case or death data broken down by race. 

## Findings:
1. Only three state health departments have included data broken down by race on virus testing: Delaware, Illinois and Kansas.
2.
