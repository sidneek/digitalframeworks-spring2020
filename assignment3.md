It's no secret that the coronavirus pandemic has hit working class communities and people of color at more devestating rates
than others. I was interested in compiling a list of gubernatorial statements and policies addressing the virus's impact on black
communities in hard hit states. Of course in an unprecedented pandemic, it's difficult to determine how to triage the onslaught
of related issues, but I wondered how state's are prioritizing issues on racial inequity highlighted by COVID-19. 
I took collected the following features:
1. State
2. Population
3. The percent of the total population that identifies as African-American
4. Total coronavirus cases
5. Whether or not the governor made a statement focused on the black community. 

I'd like to further investigate this information by taking a look at what action each state is taking individually.
I got population numbers & demographics from U.S. census data and took total virus cases from state health department reports.
Statements from governors were based on clip searches.
