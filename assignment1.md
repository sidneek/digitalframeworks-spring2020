### 311 Call Increases in Gentrifying Areas

Gentrification has an impact on the entire ecosystem of a community -- economic,cultural, and political componenents are all in play when a neighborhood is overhauled by development projects. I want to take a look at how gentrification impacts a community's relationship with police and overall policing practices. Studies in city's like New York, San Francisco and DC have shown that 311 calls typically go up when developers begin projects in low-income and minority communities, making their residents more susceptible to abuse from police. I'd focus the story on the South Side of Chicago, especially the communities South Shore, Kenwood and Woodlawn that surround the site where the Obama Presidential Center is slated to be built. Questions that I'd ask in this project are:
1. How has the volume of 311 calls changed since the groundbreaking of major development projects in these neighborhoods?
2. What is the nature of the calls?

City Lab published a story on this idea in 2015, [When Racial Boundaries Are Blurry, Neighbors Take Complaints Straight to 311](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2015/08/when-racial-boundaries-are-blurry-neighbors-take-complaints-straight-to-311/402135/). Here is my critique of the story:

**Objective: Clarity & Accuracy**
Score: 3
The headline and lede of this story clearly emphasize the author's overall tone on the topic but there's not clear insights from the data until well within the story. 

**Navigation**
Score: 4
The story uses visualizations from an outside source to illustrate the data on 311 calls and where they happen the most. Because the geocoded map is color coded it's pretty reader-friendly.
